# API Design and Specs

𝗧𝗼𝗽 𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟮.

A machine-readable description of an API or service that details its endpoints, data models, and other relevant information is found in an API specification document. Here are some of the top API specification trends observed in the last 3 years by APImatic:

𝗣𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗺𝗮𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 – 𝗠𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗣𝗼𝗽𝘂𝗹𝗮𝗿 𝗜𝗻𝗽𝘂𝘁

Nearly 30,000 users have solely used Postman Collections as input into APIMatic in the last three years, either to convert their API specs to another format or to produce SDKs/Developer portals. OpenAPI files made up the majority of the second-highest number of input API specifications.

The number of APIMatic imports for the Insomnia specification approximately doubled shortly after Kong purchased Insomnia at the end of 2019. Due to the format's relative youth, it saw far less imports than Postman Collections (it being the closest alternative to Insomnia). But ever since, its use has been rapidly rising.

Contrary to Postman's 2021 State of the API Report's API Specifications figures \[1], APIMatic observed an increase in the number of imports of the more recent OpenAPI version v3.0 compared to v2.0.

𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝘃𝟯.𝟭 – 𝗦𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗮𝗻𝗰𝘆

Early in February 2021, OpenAPI announced the release of version 3.1, and late in September, APIMatic added support for it. It takes time for tools and end users to adjust to newer versions of specifications, as was shown in the case of OpenAPI v3.0 adoption rates compared to v2.0 adoption rates.

The most frequently stated API specification for REST APIs in articles is usually OpenAPI/Swagger. However, you may also frequently see WADL, RAML, and API Blueprint listed as alternatives.

As was previously said, throughout the previous three years, more OpenAPI v3.0 imports were made than OpenAPI v2.0 imports. Surprisingly, the quantity of OpenAPI v2.0 exports remained about the same as before, if not more.

There have been some intriguing use-cases involving API specification modifications over the past three years.

* Postman to OpenAPI
* OpenAPI v3 to OpenAPI/Swagger v2
* SOAP to REST
* Insomnia to Postman
