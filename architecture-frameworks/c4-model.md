# C4 Model

The **C4 model** is a lean graphical notation technique for modelling the architecture of software systems.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4\_model#cite\_note-:0-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4\_model#cite\_note-:1-2) It is based on a structural decomposition of a system into containers and components and relies on existing modelling techniques such as the [Unified Modelling Language (UML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified\_Modeling\_Language) or [Entity Relation Diagrams (ERD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship\_model) for the more detailed decomposition of the architectural building blocks.



The C4 model documents the architecture of a [software system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software\_system), by showing multiple points of view[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4\_model#cite\_note-5) that explain the decomposition of a system into containers and [components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based\_software\_engineering), the relationship between these elements, and, where appropriate, the relation with its users.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4\_model#cite\_note-:2-3)

The viewpoints are organized according to their hierarchical level:[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4\_model#cite\_note-:1-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4\_model#cite\_note-:2-3)

* Context diagrams (level 1): show the system in scope and its relationship with users and other systems;
* Container diagrams (level 2): decompose a system into interrelated containers. A container represents an application or a data store;
* Component diagrams (level 3): decompose containers into interrelated components, and relate the components to other containers or other systems;
* Code diagrams (level 4): provide additional details about the design of the architectural elements that can be mapped to code. The C4 model relies at this level on existing notations such as [Unified Modelling Language (UML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified\_Modeling\_Language), [Entity Relation Diagrams (ERD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship\_model) or diagrams generated by [Integrated Development Environments (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated\_development\_environment).
