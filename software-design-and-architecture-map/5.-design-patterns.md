# 5. Design Patterns

Just about every problem in software has been categorized and solved already. We call these patterns: design patterns, actually.

The GoF Design Patterns are broken into three categories: Creational Patterns for the creation of objects; Structural Patterns to provide relationship between objects; and finally, Behavioral Patterns to help define how objects interact.

### Gang of Four Design Patterns

#### Creational Design Patterns

* [Abstract Factory](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/abstract-factory-design-pattern/). Allows the creation of objects without specifying their concrete type.
* [Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder). **Builder** is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
* [Factory Method](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/factory-method-design-pattern/). Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
* [Prototype](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/prototype-pattern/). Creates a new object from an existing object.
* [Singleton](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/singleton-design-pattern/). Ensures only one instance of an object is created.

#### Structural Design Patterns

* [Adapter](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/adapter-pattern/). Allows for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing classes.
* [Bridge](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/bridge-pattern/). Decouples an abstraction so two classes can vary independently.
* [Composite](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/composite-pattern/). Takes a group of objects into a single object.
* [Decorator](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/decorator-pattern/). Allows for an objectâ€™s behavior to be extended dynamically at run time.
* [Facade](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/facade-pattern/). Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.
* [Flyweight](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/flyweight-pattern/). Reduces the cost of complex object models.
* [Proxy](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/proxy-pattern/). Provides a placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access, reduce cost, or reduce complexity.

#### Behavior Design Patterns

* [Chain of Responsibility](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility-pattern/). Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
* [Command](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/command-pattern/). Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
* [Interpreter](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/interpreter-pattern/). Implements a specialized language.
* [Iterator](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/iterator-pattern/). Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
* [Mediator](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/mediator-pattern/). Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
* [Memento](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/memento-pattern/). Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.
* [Observer](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/observer-pattern/). Is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
* [State](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/state-pattern/). Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
* [Strategy](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/strategy-pattern/). Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at run-time.
* [Template Method](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/template-method-pattern/). Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide concrete behavior.
* [Visitor](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/visitor-pattern/). Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.

#### Design pattern criticisms <a href="#designpatterncriticisms" id="designpatterncriticisms"></a>

Design patterns are great and all, but sometimes they can an additional complexity to our designs. It's important to remember YAGNI and attempt to keep our designs as simple as possible. Only use design patterns when you're really sure you need them. You'll know when you will.

If we know what each of these patterns are, when to use them, and when to _not even bother_ using them, we're in good shape to begin to understand how to architect larger systems.

The reason behind that is because **architectural patterns are just design patterns blown-up in scale to the high-level**, where design patterns are low-level implementations (closer to classes and functions).
