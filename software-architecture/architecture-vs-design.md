# Architecture vs Design

Architecture is design, but not all design is architecture. That is, many design decisions are left unbound by the architecture—it is, after all, an abstraction—and depend on the discretion and good judgment of downstream designers and even implementers.\

**Updated:** We often use these two keywords in our daily work life “Design” and “Architecture”. But what is an actual difference in Design and Architecture?

Architecture is the logical implementation of Software.

Design is the physical implementation of Software.

The architecture describes what and where we need to do things whereas design illustrates how to do things.

Architecture deal with essential things whereas Design dealings with detailed implementation.

The architecture provides a high-level arrangement of components or modules. Whereas Design provides a detail arrangement within component how they communicate with each other, what design pattern used to solve this problem. How to break down complexity and which design pattern is applicable. The architect provides a high-level arrangement of components, leaves modules or components design to module designer.

Architecture support non-functional requirements (like logging, load balancing, fault tolerant, cloud supported, Testing approach, Documentation, Scalability, Security, Maintainability etc) and has to be review and approved by other architects. The design support functional requirement and the design changes are internal to component whereas Architecture changes refer to the architectural change
